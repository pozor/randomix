## 🚀 Tips & Tricks

### Number Generator
- **Tip:** Turn off "Allow repetitions" to exhaust all numbers in a range
- **Tip:** Use History sorting to find min/max generated values
- **Tip:** Previous number display helps avoid accidental re-rolls

### Phrase Generator
- **Tip:** Assign weight=10 to frequently wanted items, weight=1 to rare items
- **Tip:** Probability = weight / total_weights (e.g., 5/(5+2+3) = 50%)
- **Tip:** Swipe to delete phrases quickly

### Distributions *(Coming Soon)*
- **Tip:** Normal distribution: μ=center, σ=spread (68% within ±1σ)
- **Tip:** Use Poisson for counting events (customers per hour, etc.)
- **Tip:** Generate 20+ numbers to see theory vs practice chart
