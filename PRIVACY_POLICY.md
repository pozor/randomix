## How Your Data is Stored

All app data is stored **locally on your device** using iOS secure storage (AsyncStorage):

## Data Sharing

**I share ZERO data.**

Randomix does NOT share, sell, rent, or transfer any data to:
- Third parties
- Advertisers
- Analytics companies
- Other apps or services
- The developer

**Why?** Because I never collect any data in the first place.

Randomix does not integrate with:
- ❌ Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ Social media platforms
- ❌ Cloud storage providers
- ❌ Crash reporting tools
- ❌ Payment processors (the app is free)

The app is completely self-contained and offline.

## Children's Privacy

Randomix is safe for all ages. Since I collect no data whatsoever, the app complies with:
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

Parents can safely allow children to use Randomix without privacy concerns.

## Your Rights

Since Randomix collects no data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. However:

- ✅ **Right to Transparency**: This policy explains my non-collection practices
- ✅ **Right to Control**: You control all data stored on your device
- ✅ **Right to Deletion**: Uninstalling removes all app data

- ❌ Camera
- ❌ Photos
- ❌ Microphone
- ❌ Location
- ❌ Contacts
- ❌ Calendar
- ❌ Notifications
- ❌ Bluetooth
- ❌ Network/Internet

If iOS shows a permission request, it's not from Randomix.
